# Remote Operation of a Crane - Arduino Uno

![Crane](https://github.com/MyrmoA/ArduinoRemoteCrane/blob/master/Crane.jpg)

The Crane displayed above has an electromagnet and two servos - one for raising and lowering the electromagnet, and the other for moving the crane left and right. Both servos and the magnet are controlled via an Arduino Uno R3. The Arduino utilizes an Ethernet Shield to connect to the internet and run a WebServer that can in turn control the hardware attached to the Arduino. 

The web page is written in HTML and handles incoming connections to the IP address (69.88.163.52). There are basic control buttons on the web page to control the crane servos and the electromagnet.  


The Remotely Operated Crane was developed as a Maintenance Project for the Senior Software Engineering course at Florida Gulf Coast University.
